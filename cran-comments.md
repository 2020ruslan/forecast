## Submission

* Fixed problems on CRAN check page.
* The note concerning overwriting `fracdiff::fitted.fracdiff()` and `fracdiff::residuals.fracdiff()` is not resolved because these functions are simply placeholders that return `.NotYetImplemented()`. 

## Test environments
* ubuntu 16.04 (on travis-ci): R 3.5.3
* ubuntu 19.10: R 3.6.1
* win-builder: R-release, R-devel, R-devel ATC, R-oldrelease
